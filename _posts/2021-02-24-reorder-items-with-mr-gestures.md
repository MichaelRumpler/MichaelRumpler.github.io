title: Reorder items with MR.Gestures

I'm often asked how you would use drag & drop to reorder items. The simplest solution is of course with [MR.Gestures](https://www.mrgestures.com). So it's time that I finally add a page to the [GestureSample](https://github.com/MichaelRumpler/GestureSample) which demonstrates that.

In my case the items have various sizes. I want to drag them around to reorder them.

## The ViewModel

I wrote a simple struct for each item:

	public struct ItemViewModel
	{
		public string Text { get; }
		public Color Color { get; }

		public ItemViewModel(string text)
		{
			Text = text;
			var rnd = new Random();
			Color = Color.FromRgb(rnd.Next(0, 255), rnd.Next(0, 255), rnd.Next(0, 255));
		}
	}

Each item has a text of various lengths and a random Color just to visualize it better.

The ViewModel of the whole page then just needs a list of those items. I also added some commands so that the View can notify the ViewModel of what is going on:

	public class DragAndDropViewModel
	{
		public List<ItemViewModel> Items { get; }

		public ICommand TappedCommand { get; }
		public ICommand StartDraggingCommand { get; }
		public ICommand DroppedCommand { get; }

I initialized the `Items` with some Pulp Fiction quotes from [slipsum.com](https://slipsum.com/) and wrapped each word in a `ItemViewModel` to get some test data.

The commands will all hold `Command<ItemViewModel>`, so the respective item will be passed to the `Execute` method.

## The View

The items should be displayed side by side in multiple rows. With different widths of the items the easiest to use is a [FlexLayout](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/xamarin/xamarin-forms/user-interface/layouts/flex-layout). The `FlexLayout` itself does not have a `ItemsSource`, but this can easily be solved with [Bindable Layouts](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/xamarin/xamarin-forms/user-interface/layouts/bindable-layouts). So my XAML becomes this:

	<FlexLayout x:Name="theFlexLayout"
		Wrap="Wrap" AlignItems="Start" AlignContent="Start">
		BindableLayout.ItemsSource="{Binding Items}"
		<BindableLayout.ItemTemplate>
			<DataTemplate>
				<Frame
					BackgroundColor="{Binding Color}"
					CornerRadius="10">
					<Label Text="{Binding Text}" HorizontalOptions="Center" />
				</Frame>
			</DataTemplate>
		</BindableLayout.ItemTemplate>
	</FlexLayout>

`Wrap`, `AlignItems` and `AlignContent` simply tell the `FlexLayout` to display the items in multiple rows top down, left to right.
`BindableLayout.ItemsSource` and `BindableLayout.ItemTemplate` are attached properties which allow to bind to my `Items` from the ViewModel.
And finally within the `DataTemplate` we have a `Frame` with a `BackgroundColor` and the `Label` bound to the `Text`.

On an iPad this looks like this:

So far so good. We didn't do any drag & drop yet.

## Adjust the View for Drag & Drop

On my other test pages in the `GestureSample` I simply changed `TranslationX/Y` to move items around. But within the `FlexLayout` I cannot do that. The item would be displayed below other items. I need to show it above the others, so I need a surrounding `Grid` where I can add the draggable item to. I also need to be notified about pan gestures on that `Grid` so I use a `MR.Gestures.Grid`.

	<mr:Grid
		x:Name="theGrid"
		RowDefinitions="3*,*"
		Panning="Grid_Panning"
		Panned="Grid_Panned">

		<FlexLayout ...

The ViewModel doesn't need to know about the drag&drop stuff. This is just View related and the VM will only be notified when dragging starts and an item is dropped. All the code for drag&drop is in the code behind of the View. So I use events in this case. The `Grid_Panning` method handles dragging and `Grid_Panned` dropping of an item.

The `Xamarin.Forms.DragGestureRecognizer` uses a long press to start a drag gesture. With MR.Gestures you have the option. I want to start it as soon as the user drags something. To get the touched item it is easiest to use the `Down` gesture.

I also want to be notified, when an item is tapped. And to be exact: the ViewModel needs to be notified because this tapping is not related to the drag&drop gesture, it triggers something in my business logic.

I replace the `Xamarin.Forms.Frame` with a `MR.Gestures.Frame` and add some gesture handlers:

	<DataTemplate>
		<mr:Frame
			TappedCommand="{Binding Source={RelativeSource AncestorType={x:Type ContentPage}}, Path=BindingContext.TappedCommand}"
			TappedCommandParameter="{Binding}"
			Down="Frame_Down"
			...

Remember: for each item within the `DataTemplate` the `BindingContext` is a `ItemViewModel`. But the `TappedCommand` is a property in `DragAndDropViewModel`. Therefore I have to search for the surrounding ContentPage up the visual tree and use its `BindingContext.TappedCommand`. This is a bit tricky, because you don't get a warning or binding error when something is wrong. I forgot the `TappedCommandParameter` and then the command was never executed because the type of the parameter was wrong. I searched for hours for the correct syntax of `RelativeSource` when in fact the problem was the missing parameter binding.

The `Down` parameter is easier. It's just the name of a method in the Views code behind.

## The Code

Lets begin with that method:

	Frame draggingObject;

	private void Frame_Down(object sender, MR.Gestures.DownUpEventArgs e)
	{
		// remember draggingObject
		draggingObject = (Frame)sender;
	}

It just remembers which `Frame` (=item) has been touched and that's it. I could also get that from the touch coordinates in the `Grid_Panning` handler, but this way you could easily replace it with e.g. `LongPressing` if you want to start dragging with a long press.

In `Grid_Panning` we first have to check, if the gesture just started.

	bool dragging = false;
	AbsoluteLayout cloneContainer;
	Frame clone;
	double x, y, w, h;
	int originalIndex, currentIndex;

	private void Grid_Panning(object sender, MR.Gestures.PanEventArgs e)
	{
		if(!dragging && draggingObject != null)
		{

Tell the ViewModel that the dragging gesture starts.

			VM.StartDraggingCommand.Execute(draggingObject.BindingContext);

`dragging` is a flag so that the View knows, that something is dragged. We could probably also do this with `draggingObject`, but it's simpler like this.

			dragging = true;

`originalIndex` is the index of the draggingObject when the gesture started, `currentIndex` is the index over which the touch is at any given time.

			originalIndex = currentIndex = theFlexLayout.Children.IndexOf(draggingObject);

Find the related `ItemViewModel`.

			var draggingItem = (DragAndDropViewModel.ItemViewModel)draggingObject.BindingContext;

Now we create a clone of the `draggingObject`. This is the object, which we will move around the screen.

			clone = new Frame()
			{
				BackgroundColor = draggingItem.Color,
				CornerRadius = draggingObject.CornerRadius,
				BorderColor = Color.Red,

				Content = new Label()
				{
					Text = draggingItem.Text,
					HorizontalOptions= LayoutOptions.Center,
				}
			};

Get position and size of the object. `GetAbsolutePosition` is a helper method which just adds up `X` and `Y` of the `draggingObject` and its parents.

			(x, y) = GetAbsolutePosition(draggingObject);
			w = draggingObject.Width;
			h = draggingObject.Height;

Add clone to the page at the same position as the `draggingObject` but on top of all other objects. For that we add an `AbsoluteLayout` to the same `Grid.Row/Column` (0/0) as the `FlexLayout`. The position of the `clone` within the `AbsoluteLayout` is the same position as the original `draggingObject`.

			cloneContainer = new AbsoluteLayout();
			cloneContainer.Children.Add(clone, new Rectangle(x, y, w, h));
			theGrid.Children.Add(cloneContainer);

Make the `draggingObject` invisible. If I set IsVisible to false, then the FlexLayout removes the child. But I want a gap where the item would be inserted so that the user can easily see where it will go. So I leave it visible, but make it transparent.

			draggingObject.Opacity = 0;
		}

The dragging gesture is started and the `clone` is in place. Now we are in the loop which will be executed every time, the finger moves on screen.

		if (dragging && draggingObject != null)
		{

Change the coordinates of the clone. Here I use `PanEventArgs.DeltaDistance` to see, how much the touch moved since the last `Panning` event.

			x += e.DeltaDistance.X;
			y += e.DeltaDistance.Y;
			AbsoluteLayout.SetLayoutBounds(clone, new Rectangle(x, y, w, h));

Check if the child under the touch coordinates changed. Here again I need MR.Gestures to get the coordinate of the first finger on the screen. `GetChildAt` is a helper method which I will not list here. You'll find it in the full source code.

			var newIndex = GetChildAt(e.Touches[0]);
			if (newIndex == -1)
				newIndex = originalIndex;

			if(newIndex != currentIndex)
			{

If the touch moved to a different item, then we remove the `draggingObject` from the old position and insert it at the new one. Remember that the `draggingObject` is transparent. So we actually only move the gap around at which the item would be dropped.

				theFlexLayout.Children.RemoveAt(currentIndex);
				theFlexLayout.Children.Insert(newIndex, draggingObject);

 We then change the `currentIndex` to the `newIndex`. A small detail which must not be forgotten.

				currentIndex = newIndex;
			}
		}
	}

When the finger is lifted from the display, the `Panned` gesture is raised.

	private void Grid_Panned(object sender, MR.Gestures.PanEventArgs e)
	{
		if (dragging && draggingObject != null)
		{

Remove the `clone` and `cloneContainer` from the page.

			theGrid.Children.Remove(cloneContainer);

Make `draggingObject` visible again. It is already at the correct position.

			draggingObject.Opacity = 1;

Change the order of the `Items` in ViewModel.

			var draggingItem = VM.Items[originalIndex];
			VM.Items.RemoveAt(originalIndex);
			VM.Items.Insert(currentIndex, draggingItem);

Tell VM that the order changed

			VM.DroppedCommand.Execute(draggingObject.BindingContext);
		}

Reset my temporary variables.

		dragging = false;
		draggingObject = null;
		clone = null;
		cloneContainer = null;
	}

This solution does not need any native code. It works out of the box on iOS, Android and UWP. I didn't test the other platforms, but they should work too.

I added the code to the [GestureSample](https://github.com/MichaelRumpler/GestureSample). So the easiest way to browse it is to check that out. When you run the sample, the test page can be found in Tests / Drag&Drop Items in FlexLayout.
