  Hello, I have been trying to figure this out, but am running into issues. I
  have created a GitHub app and have my own instance of Staticman on Heroku.
  When I go to the root URL of my Heroko Staticman, I get the “Hello from
  Staticman version 3.0.0!” message. In my site configs, when I use the v3/entry
  it doesn’t work. When I change it to v2/entry in my site config, it does work.
  It seems like my Github app and Heroku are communicating as expected since I
  get a pull request with v2/entry, but I do not know why v3 doesn’t work. I
  feel like I am missing something obvious, but cannot figure it out and various
  documentation on Staticman is older than the Github App configuration, so it’s
  hard to put the pieces together sometimes. I built my Heroku instance from the
  Master branch of the Staticman repository, if that is helpful.
