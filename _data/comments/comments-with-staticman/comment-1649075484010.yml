  Ah, yes. I am seeing the "GitHub" addition in the URLs on your website and
  others now. I think since the URL looked so similar between v2 and v3, I
  didn't notice the addition of "GitHub" to the URL for v3. Thank you for your
  help and for sharing your experience with this article and your source code.
  It is very helpful!
