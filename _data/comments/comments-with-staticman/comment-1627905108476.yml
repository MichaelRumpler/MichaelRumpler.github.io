  I tried to configure in my GitHub pages for 'Staticman version 3', as you
  described, I deployed the app in Heroku, created GitHub app as you said in the
  description. Added staticman endpoint in  _config.yml. I opened the app from
  heroku and got the response 'Hello from Staticman version 3.0.0!'. When I try
  to add comments on page, it shows the error 'Sorry, there was an error with
  your submission. Please make sure all required fields have been completed and
  try again'. Already all fields are filled up.
