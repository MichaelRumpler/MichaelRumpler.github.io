  The required fields can be found in staticman.yml. It is called
  "requiredFields". Check if it contains something which you don't have in your
  comment form (_includes/comments.html). If your requiredFields contain e.g.
  "url", then your comments form must also contain a respective input field with
  name="fields[url]". You can also check in the heroku log or in the browsers
  debugger what parameters have really been submitted.
