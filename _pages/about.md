Hi, my name is Michael and I'm a software developer.

But more important is, that I'm married and I live with my wife and cat in a small town south of Vienna, Austria.
I love to play Squash and Badminton, travelling and hiking.

### Working life

I work in IT since 1993. After 10 years as sysadmin I switched over to be a software developer.

Most of my time as a professional developer I used C# for the backend and JavaScript for the web frontend.
Sometimes I also needed to use Java, but only if the client required it.

C# can really be used everywhere for everything. I wrote big web applications with it, Windows
desktop apps with WPF, Android and iOS apps with Xamarin. I even used C# for some UWP and macOS apps -
although I wouldn't say that I'm very experienced with these.

In 2014 I joined [Royal Applications](https://www.royalapplications.com/) to write new versions of
[Royal TSi](https://www.royalapplications.com/ts/ios/features) for iOS and
[Royal TSD](https://www.royalapplications.com/ts/android/features) for Android.

Xamarin released version 1.0 of Xamarin.Forms at that time and I used it for my apps.
Soon I realized, that Xamarin.Forms still had many deficiencies.
One of those was the lack of touch gesture handling. What is a mobile app without proper touch handling?
I needed it for my apps and figured everybody else would need that too.
So I decided to abstract it away properly and make it publicly available.
[MR.Gestures](https://www.mrgestures.com/) was born.
