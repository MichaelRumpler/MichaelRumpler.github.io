Hi, I'm Michael and I'm a software developer.

I live with my wife and cat in a small town south of Vienna, Austria.
I love to play Squash and Badminton, traveling and hiking.
Occasionally I also have to work, but I'm lucky enough to do that mostly from home.

### Working life

I work in IT since 1993. After 10 years as sysadmin I switched over to be a freelance software developer.

Most of my time as a professional developer I used C# for the backend and JavaScript for the web frontend.
Sometimes I also needed to use Java, but only if the client required it.

C# can really be used everywhere for everything. I wrote big web applications with it, Windows
desktop apps with WPF and Avalonia, Android and iOS apps with Xamarin. I even used C# for some UWP and macOS apps -
although I wouldn't say that I'm very experienced with these.

My last long lasting client was [Royal Apps](https://www.royalapps.com/) from 2014 to 2024. I wrote
[Royal TSi](https://www.royalapplications.com/ts/ios/features) for iOS and
[Royal TSD](https://www.royalapplications.com/ts/android/features) for Android.

Xamarin released version 1.0 of Xamarin.Forms when I started there and I used it for my apps.
Soon I realized, that Xamarin.Forms still had many deficiencies.
One of those was the lack of touch gesture handling. What is a mobile app without proper touch handling?
I needed it for my apps and figured everybody else would need that too.
So I decided to abstract it away properly and make it publicly available.
[MR.Gestures](https://www.mrgestures.com/) was born.
